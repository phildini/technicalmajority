    Tech Solidarity is intended to bring the tech world together with the local communities where it lives to discuss practical steps we can take in the face of a Trump administration, while there is still ample time to prepare and plan.
    We'll operate on the assumption that Trump means what he says, and that he will work to implement the policies he campaigned on, including mass deportations, "extreme vetting" of immigrants and visitors, and a registry of Muslim Americans.
    Together we hope we can find ways to minimize the impact of these policies, help people defend their rights (and fight back), and lobby the companies we work to stop collecting and storing sensitive data wherever possible.

    The tech community at its best stands for openness, inclusion, collaboration and innovation. These values stand in stark contrast to the kind of world the Trump Administration is trying to create.
    As members of the tech community we commit to resisting the Trump Administration’s efforts to divide, to silence, to persecute and to oppress.
    We will resist by harnessing our unique skills and resources behind efforts to promote truth, engage citizens, hold elected officials accountable, and push for justice.

    Volunteer coders behind Bernie Sanders' 2016 campaign cemented the role of volunteer tech in politics.
    Hundreds of coders created online tools for his campaign, boosting the movement by engaging millions of people to vote, volunteer, and inform themselves about the issues.
    We're building on that momentum and creating a sustainable network of volunteers: creating open-source tools for the progressive movement; helping progressive campaigns compete without needing millions of dollars in funding; enabling them to champion a platform centered in social and economic justice without big money's influence.
