# Technical Majority

Hello! This is the repo that maintains https://technicalmajority.com, a catalog
for information about technology partnering with activists and governments to
increase government by the people, for the people, of the people.

Think of this as an HTML wiki, we very much want additions and contributions.

All contributions and interactions are governed by our code of conduct.

## Get started!

A great place to start would be adding projects, organizations, or resources. 
Look under the `docs/_data` for the appropriate YAML files, and follow the
pattern there to add items.
